# Git Commands Practice Repository

Welcome to my Git Commands Practice Repository! 🚀

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to practicing and understanding various Git commands. I will experiment with different Git operations, track changes, and analyze how each command affects the repository.

## 🔥 What I Will Do Here
- Initialize and configure Git repositories
- Work with branches, commits, and merges
- Explore rebasing, cherry-picking, and stashing
- Collaborate using remotes and pull requests
- Experiment with undoing changes and handling conflicts
- Understand tags, logs, and history tracking

## 📂 Repository Structure
```

│-- README.md  (This File)
│-- sample_file.txt  (Test file for practice)
│-- experiments/  (Folder containing various Git command tests)
```

## ⚡ Commands I Will Explore
Here are some Git commands I plan to practice:

### Basic Commands
- `git init` - Initialize a new repository
- `git clone <repo_url>` - Clone an existing repository
- `git status` - Check the status of changes
- `git add <file>` - Stage files for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit changes
- `git log` - View commit history

### Branching and Merging
- `git branch` - List, create, or delete branches
- `git checkout <branch>` - Switch branches
- `git merge <branch>` - Merge branches
- `git rebase <branch>` - Reapply commits on top of another base

### Remote Repositories
- `git remote add origin <url>` - Add a remote repository
- `git push origin <branch>` - Push commits to a remote branch
- `git pull origin <branch>` - Fetch and merge remote changes

### Undoing Changes
- `git reset --hard <commit>` - Reset to a specific commit
- `git revert <commit>` - Revert a commit by creating a new one
- `git stash` - Temporarily save uncommitted changes

### Advanced Topics
- `git cherry-pick <commit>` - Apply a specific commit to another branch
- `git bisect` - Find the commit that introduced a bug
- `git tag` - Create, list, or delete tags

## 📜 Notes and Learnings
Throughout this practice, I will document my learnings and key insights in a separate file: `git_notes.md`.

## 🎯 Goals
- Gain confidence using Git in various workflows
- Understand the impact of different Git commands
- Improve collaboration skills with Git and GitHub
